    ">R-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure that indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables in a linear regression model. It is a commonly used metric to evaluate the goodness of fit of a linear regression model.\n",
    "\n",

    ">In simpler terms, R-squared represents the percentage of the variation in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables in the model. For example, an R-squared value of 0.8 means that 80% of the variation in the dependent variable can be explained by the independent variables in the model, while the remaining 20% is due to other factors or random error.\n",
